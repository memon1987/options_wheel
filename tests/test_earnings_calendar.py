"""EarningsCalendarService — the tri-state surface, the constructor, the cache.

Plan: docs/plans/fc-013.md §1 (and the FC-007 test debt this finally pays).

The load-bearing case in this file is **clear vs unknown**. Rev 1 of FC-013
tried to make the existing boolean surface fail closed by flipping its error
paths to ``True``; that method's ``None`` branch conflates "Finnhub failed"
with "no earnings in the next 90 days", so the flip would have blocked every
known-clear symbol — an account-wide brick on a normal day. Every test below
that distinguishes the two is guarding that.
