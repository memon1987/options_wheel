"""WheelEngine dependency-injection seam (FC-032 Phase 3).

The backtest replays the *actual* live code rather than a reimplementation of
it. That only works if injecting one client redirects every component the
engine builds. If any of them quietly keeps a real AlpacaClient, a replay would
fire live API calls mid-simulation.

FC-068 shrank what the engine builds: the put seller, call seller and gap
detector existed only to feed the deleted orchestration path, and the simulator
now constructs its own scanner and sellers on the same injected client (see
``tests/test_backtest_simulator.py``). What the engine still hangs off the
client is its market-data manager and, per roll cycle, the CallRoller.

Production behavior is unchanged: omit the argument and the real client is built.
