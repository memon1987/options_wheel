"""Cloud Run detection must recognise Jobs, not just Services.

FC-059: `_is_cloud_run()` checked only `K_SERVICE`. Cloud Run **Services** set
that variable; Cloud Run **Jobs** set `CLOUD_RUN_JOB` / `CLOUD_RUN_EXECUTION`.
So inside a Job the check returned False, `log_to_file` became True, and logs
were written to a file inside a container whose filesystem is destroyed on exit.

The monthly backtest screen runs as a Job. Without this, it emits **nothing** to
Cloud Logging and a failure is undiagnosable — the operator sees "task failed"
with no reason. Found by watching the first real Job execution produce zero
application logs in 19 minutes.
