"""Simulator day loop (FC-032 Phase 3).

The golden path: the simulator drives the *real* production pipeline over
canned data — ``OptionsScanner`` → ``ExecutionEngine`` (filter → rank →
select_batch → execute_batch) → ``PutSeller``/``CallSeller``. Nothing here
stubs strategy logic; if a rule is wrong, it is wrong in production too.

FC-068 repointed the generation half off ``WheelEngine.run_strategy_cycle()``,
which production abandoned in 2025. These tests are the acceptance criteria of
that repoint: they passed against the engine path and must pass, with
assertions unweakened, against the pipeline that actually trades.

        This test used to assert ``rolls_executed == 0``. That was the whole

        scheduler invokes this exact code, and the assertion made the seat
        load-bearing instead of silent, so that reviving the roller would flip a
        test rather than quietly change every backtest number.

        FC-078 is that revival, and the flip is intentional. Two things changed

        actually execute (the quote-key mismatch that made it a guaranteed
