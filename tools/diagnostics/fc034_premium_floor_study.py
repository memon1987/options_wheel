"""FC-034 (FC-042 Track B2) — is a flat $0.50 put-premium floor the right *shape*?

PURPOSE
-------
`min_put_premium: 0.50` (config/settings.yaml) is a fixed dollar hurdle applied
identically to a $12 stock and a $340 one. FC-032's coverage gate found F, PFE,
KMI and VZ have ~zero usable decision days despite 122/122 bar coverage, and
FC-042 Track C found VZ collects $0 dividends because it never holds shares.
FC-034 asks: **demote those four, or re-shape the threshold?**

This harness produces the evidence. It never modifies production code or config;
every arm is injected into a *fresh* `Config` object (and, for the non-flat
shapes, by wrapping `MarketDataManager._check_{put,call}_criteria_detailed` for
the duration of one run).

LAYERS
------
  chain    Chain-level census, no engine. Walks every decision day, records
           every priced put/call in the delta band, and then evaluates ANY floor
           shape offline from that one pass. Cheap, exhaustive, and it separates
           "the contract did not exist" from "the contract existed and did not
           pay the floor". Also runs a parameter sweep the engine cannot afford.

  engine   The A/B proper. Drives the real backtest engine once per (symbol,
           arm), reporting trades enabled, return on collateral, total return,
           max drawdown, days-in-position fraction, win rate, assignment rate
           and the engine's own fitness verdict (`insufficient` included —
           a two-trade annualized number is not a result).

  fills    The real-fills layer, and the reason this study exists in this shape.
           FC-036 proved engine-only A/B can mislead: it called a threshold
           "free" that 330 real fills showed was a $1,900 tax. Here we (a) prove
           from production data which underlyings actually traded, and (b) replay
           each proposed floor against every real sell-to-open fill to price what
           the re-shape would have *destroyed* on the names that already work.

  report   Assembles the tables the write-up quotes.

USAGE
-----
    # optional: parallel cold-cache warm (see run_prefetch)
    python tools/diagnostics/fc034_premium_floor_study.py prefetch --symbol F \
        --shard 0 --shards 6
    python tools/diagnostics/fc034_premium_floor_study.py chain --symbol F
    python tools/diagnostics/fc034_premium_floor_study.py engine --symbol F
    python tools/diagnostics/fc034_premium_floor_study.py fills
    python tools/diagnostics/fc034_premium_floor_study.py report

Output defaults to $FC034_OUT or /tmp/fc034. One symbol per process; arms within
a symbol share the warm parquet chain cache (the strike window the simulator
requests is derived from bars alone, so it is arm-independent — see
`Simulator._strike_anchors` — and every arm therefore hits the same files).

#     in production: IWM 27 puts + 8 calls, AAPL 8 puts + 3 calls.
#   * Both stay inside the stage-1 price band [min_stock_price 10,
#     max_stock_price 400] for the ENTIRE window. SPY (454.76-759.57) and QQQ
#     (385.05-746.16) never do — they are excluded by the *price cap*, not by
#     the premium floor, so they cannot function as controls for this question.
#     AMD (78-581), MSFT (353-542), UNH (238-625) and GOOGL (129-403) all breach
#     400 for part of the window, which would confound arm comparison with
#     stage-1 dropouts.
#   * Neither split in 2023-12-01..2026-07-28 (detect_split → None). NVDA did
#     (10:1 on 2024-06-10), which would force a truncated, non-comparable window.
#   * They bracket the premium regime the re-shape must not damage: a $165-340
#     single name and a $175-300 ETF. IWM is the closest liquid name to the
#     $12-48 excluded cohort, so it is the most sensitive control available.
