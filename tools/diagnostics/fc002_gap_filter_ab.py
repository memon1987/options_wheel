"""FC-002 / FC-042 B1 — A/B the **stage-2** gap-risk filter.

SCOPE
-----
This studies `GapDetector.analyze_gap_risk` / `_is_suitable_for_trading`
(`src/risk/gap_detector.py`) — the stage-2 symbol filter that combines

  * gap **frequency**: share of days in the lookback whose overnight gap exceeds
    `quality_gap_threshold` (2.0%), capped at `max_gap_frequency` (0.15), and
  * a realized-**vol** cap: annualized vol over the same lookback, capped at
    `max_historical_vol` (0.40), and
  * a **current-gap** rule: today's overnight gap above
    `max_overnight_gap_percent` (5.0%) blocks the day outright.

It is NOT the stage-4 execution gap gate (`can_execute_trade`), which is a
different control studied in docs/investigations/fc-036-gap-gate-study.md.

Two measured facts about the live filter that the FC entry gets wrong, both
verified by `layer1 --selfcheck`:

  * `vol_lookback_days: 252` in config/settings.yaml is **dead config**. Nothing
    reads `Config.vol_lookback_days`. The vol is computed over whatever frame
    `analyze_gap_risk` fetched, which is `gap_lookback_days + 20` = **50
    CALENDAR days** (~34 sessions).
  * The same 50-calendar-day frame carries the gap-frequency ratio, so both legs
    of the filter share one window.

LAYERS
------
  layer1    Filter reconstruction from daily bars, no engine. Per symbol-day:
            gap frequency, realized vol, the trailing-1y percentile of that
            symbol's own vol, and the block verdict + binding reason for every
            arm. Answers "what is actually binding, and how often".

  layer2    Engine A/B. Drives the real backtest engine once per arm. Fixed-cap
            arms are pure config injection; the vol-relative and graduated arms
            are analysis-side monkeypatches on GapDetector (production is never
            modified).

  layer3    REAL FILLS from BigQuery `options_wheel.trades_from_activities`
            (read-only). The filter's premise is "high realized vol predicts bad
            outcomes". This tests that against 330 real sell-to-open fills by
            bucketing every entry on its trailing vol at entry and reporting
            what those entries actually earned. Also calibrates the overlay's
            premium model by inverting Black-Scholes on each real fill.

  overlay   Daily-bar synthetic short-put overlay over the full 2024-02..2026-07
            window. The engine trades so rarely under the live filter that its
            arms are near-empty; this prices a 7-DTE ~0.175-delta put on EVERY
            symbol-day from bars plus the layer-3-calibrated IV model, so
            "blocked days vs allowed days" is answered on thousands of
            observations instead of dozens. Premium is MODELED — the layer
            reports its own sign-stability under +/-20% premium scaling.

  markdown  Emit the document tables from the JSON produced above.

RE-RUN
------
    OUT=/tmp/fc002
    python3 tools/diagnostics/fc002_gap_filter_ab.py layer1  --out $OUT
    python3 tools/diagnostics/fc002_gap_filter_ab.py layer3  --out $OUT   # needs gcloud auth

    python3 tools/diagnostics/fc002_gap_filter_ab.py layer2  --symbol NVDA --out $OUT
    python3 tools/diagnostics/fc002_gap_filter_ab.py markdown --out $OUT

`layer2` is the expensive one; run one symbol per process. It reads the parquet
chain cache under `cache/backtest/chains/` (gitignored), so a warm cache makes
the arms cheap.

    Why this layer exists: under the live filter the engine opens between 1 and
    30 positions per symbol over 2.5 years, so its arms cannot distinguish a
    good threshold from a bad one. This one prices an entry on every session, so
    "are blocked days actually worse than allowed days" is answered on thousands
    of observations.

    Premium is MODELED, not observed: implied vol comes from the layer-3 OLS fit
    of real fill IV on trailing realized vol, and the fill takes the engine's
    0.25 haircut off a modeled spread. That is the layer's weakness, so every
    comparison is also reported under +/-20% premium scaling; a conclusion that
    flips under that scaling is not reported as a conclusion.

    Outcome is the wheel's own: hold to expiry, keep the premium, take
    assignment. `pnl = premium - max(0, K - S_T) * 100`. No early close and no
    covered-call leg after assignment, which understates BOTH arms' income and
    is why the layer is read as a comparison, not a level.
