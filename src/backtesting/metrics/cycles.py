"""Per-wheel-cycle analytics, reconstructed from the broker ledger.

A *cycle* is one full turn of the wheel on one underlying: it opens when the
first option is sold while flat in that name, and closes when the name returns to
flat — no shares, no open options. In between it may contain several puts
(expired worthless, re-sold), an assignment, a run of covered calls, rolls, and
dividends.

Everything here is arithmetic over ``BacktestBroker.ledger``. Nothing is
re-derived from strategy logic, so a cycle table cannot disagree with the cash
that actually moved.

The separation that matters most is **option P&L vs stock P&L**. Published wheel
studies find ~94-99% of total return comes from the stock leg; a report that
blends them hides whether the strategy is earning premium or just being long. So
each cycle carries both, and they are never summed into a single number without
also being shown apart.
