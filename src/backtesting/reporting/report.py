"""Markdown + JSON rendering of a fitness report.

The report's job is to be *hard to misread*. Three things it always does:

- shows option-leg and stock-leg P&L apart, never only their sum;
- states the buy-and-hold result next to the strategy result;
- carries a footer of known biases, so a reader never has to guess whether a
  number is measured, modeled, or unmodeled.

Numbers come pre-computed from ``metrics.fitness``; nothing is calculated here
beyond formatting.

        "are included. Neither leg REINVESTS: the benchmark's dividends are "
        "added as flat cash at the end rather than buying more shares, while "
        "the wheel's land in cash on the ex-date where they can back the next "
