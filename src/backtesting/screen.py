"""Screen mode — evaluate the whole universe on a cadence.

Where `evaluate` answers "is this candidate symbol a fit?", screen answers
"which symbols we currently trade have stopped being one?" It runs every
configured symbol through the same engine, writes one row per symbol to
`options_wheel.backtest_runs`, and flags demotion candidates.

**Demotion stays a human decision.** The row carries `demote=true` as a
recommendation and the reasons behind it; nothing here changes the trading
universe. The plan is explicit that two cycles should be observed before any
automation is wired, and the fidelity caveats (unmodeled dividends, unmodeled
early assignment, a single vol regime) are exactly why.

A symbol that fails still gets a row, carrying its error. Dropping it would make
the run look like it screened fewer symbols than it attempted — the difference
between "this symbol is fine" and "this symbol was never checked".
