"""The day loop — drives the live strategy over history.

Each simulated trading day:

    freeze the clock  ->  wheel_engine.reconcile_positions()  (housekeeping)
                      ->  OptionsScanner.scan_for_put_opportunities()
                          + scan_for_call_opportunities()      (find candidates)
                      ->  ExecutionEngine: filter -> rank -> select -> execute
                      ->  wheel_engine.run_rolling_cycle()   (daily, FC-078)
                      ->  settle expirations against today's close
                      ->  record equity

That is the production pipeline verbatim: ``/scan`` builds candidates with
``OptionsScanner`` and ``/run`` filters, ranks, batch-selects and executes them
with ``ExecutionEngine``. FC-068 repointed the generation half here. Before it,
the replay called ``WheelEngine.run_strategy_cycle()`` — a code path production
abandoned on 2025-10-03, three days before the live account's first fill — so
every backtest measured a strategy with a drawdown pause, gap filtering,
wheel-state phase gating, per-cycle caps and single-candidate selection that
production does not have, and *without* the two-pool batch selection and
committed-share ledger it does.

Three orderings here were learned the hard way, and all are load-bearing.

**Execution is a second phase.** The scan only *finds* opportunities;
production executes them separately (``/run`` → ``ExecutionEngine``). A day
loop that stops after the scan places no trades at all and reports a flawless
zero-trade backtest.

**Settlement runs after the decision.** A contract expiring today is still held
when the strategy looks at its book — that is what the live bot sees at 3:45pm —
and resolves against today's official close. Settling first removes the expiring
position before the scan, so the scanner's "already have a position on this
symbol" check waves through a fresh put on the same underlying, expiring the
same day, which then never settles.

**The opportunity blob is not simulated.** ``/scan`` and ``/run`` sit ~15
minutes apart in production, so live executes against fresher quotes than it
scanned on; the replay scans and executes on one snapshot. That was true before
FC-068 too — unchanged, and now stated in ``docs/BACKTEST_ENGINE.md``. For the
same reason ``OpportunityStore`` is never constructed here: the hand-off is
in-memory, so a replay writes no GCS blobs.

Nothing in here reimplements strategy logic. If a rule is wrong, it is wrong in
production too — which is the entire point of FC-032.

        Chains are built for the whole window *before* the day loop starts, so
        at build time there is no position to read a real cost basis from. What
        we can do is bound the prices any position can be struck against:

        * **Ceiling** — shares only ever arrive by put assignment, and the wheel
          only sells puts struck at or below spot, so no lot this run acquires
          can cost more than the highest close (assignment at strike K <= the
          close on the day it was sold, less premium). This keeps the call
          ladder above cost basis fetched even for a position that goes deeply
          underwater later.
        * **Floor** — the mirror case: a short put stays on the book while the
          underlying rallies, and its strike must remain in the chain or the
          position marks at zero and cannot be closed. The lowest close bounds
          the lowest strike the run can ever be short.

        Both are computed from **decision-window bars only**. Warm-up bars
        exist only to give day one the metric lookback live would have had, and
        a split inside the warm-up buffer is explicitly tolerated (see
        ``run``) — for NVDA that
        means a pre-split close of 1224.40 sitting in the same series as a ~180
        spot. Including it would set the ceiling ~7x too high and silently turn
        the strike filter into a no-op for every run starting within the warm-up
        buffer of the June 2024 split.

        Using the window's later closes to widen a *fetch* is not lookahead: it
        can only grow the set of contracts offered to the strategy, never change
        any contract's point-in-time price, and the alternative — a spot-centred
        window — is the one that would alter decisions by hiding contracts the
        strategy is holding. The cost is extra strikes fetched on trending
        symbols, which grows with window length; see the plan's follow-up note
        on building chains lazily per-day instead.

        set of sessions for which this symbol has a bar; an ex-date landing on a

        would drop that dividend from the wheel while the benchmark — which sums

        would then be measured against different dividend streams, which is the
        precise failure this track exists to remove.

        Crediting it on the next session the wheel can be observed on is also
        correct on the ownership test: the holder held through the prior close.
