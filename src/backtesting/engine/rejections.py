"""Tally *why* the strategy declined to trade on each decision day.

A fitness verdict that does not name its own binding constraint is close to
useless for the decision it feeds. An adversarial review produced an AMD run
reading "unfit, held a position on 5 of 60 decision days" — while the real story
was that candidates existed on 41 of those 60 days and the gap-risk filter
excluded the symbol from 2025-01-13 onward. A reader concludes "AMD is a bad
wheel symbol" when the finding is "our gap filter excludes AMD in elevated-vol
regimes." Those imply completely different actions.

Rather than reimplement the filter logic (which would immediately drift from the
live code this FC exists to replay), this listens to the structured events the
live stages *already* emit and counts them.
