"""Backtest broker — the authoritative cash-and-positions ledger.

This is the only place money and shares move. It is deliberately separate from
``WheelStateManager`` (which tracks *strategy phase*): the broker knows nothing
about the wheel, only about cash, collateral, stock lots, short option
positions, fills, fees, assignment, and dividends. The old engine's fictional
2:1 buying power and parallel bookkeeping are gone — cash-secured means exactly
that, and available cash excludes reserved collateral.

Conventions:
  * The wheel only ever *sells* options (short puts, short calls) and buys them
    back to close, so every OptionPosition is short (``contracts`` > 0).
  * Cash-secured puts reserve ``strike * 100 * contracts`` from cash; covered
    calls reserve nothing (the shares are the cover).
  * Fills interpolate between mark (mid) and the near side of the modeled
    spread by ``fill_haircut``: selling fills toward the bid, buying toward the
    ask. haircut=0 fills at mid (optimistic); haircut=1 fills at the far quote
    (worst case). Default 0.25 per the plan.
  * Assignment at expiration follows OCC exercise-by-exception: a short is
    assigned iff it is in the money by >= $0.01 versus the underlying close.
