"""FC-065 Phase 4 — the per-symbol covered-call decision record.

For any held symbol on any cycle this module produces a durable answer to
"did we sell a call, and if not, why not."  It exists because the honest
answer today is *silence*: an underwater position yields nothing, no event
says so, and the structured logs that would tell you live only in Cloud
Logging's 30-day window (the BigQuery sink died 2025-11-22 — FC-046).

Shape, adopted from **FC-044 Phase 1's `decision_events` design** (that
phase is subsumed here; FC-044's Phase 2 grid UI reads this table):

  * one row per ``(run_id, symbol, stage)`` — the dedup key,
  * a **closed** outcome enum with a per-outcome reason vocabulary,
  * two legibility labels on every row (``underwater_pct``,
    ``uncovered_days``) — what survives of FC-029 R3 after OQ-3 removed the
    pause gate,
  * written through ``AnalyticsWriter`` to a dedicated, code-schema'd
    BigQuery table, never through the dead log sink.

Two deliberate departures from FC-044's sketch, both recorded in the plan's
Execution notes:

1. FC-044 proposed a ``metrics JSON`` column.  This module flattens the
   metrics to typed scalars and models the chain-rejection breakdown as a
   REPEATED RECORD instead.  String-ifying structures into a BigQuery column
   is the 2026-04-07 schema lesson this codebase paid for once already.
2. FC-044's ``gate`` column is folded into ``stage`` + ``reason``; a separate
   gate name would have been a third vocabulary saying the same thing.

**A cycle produces exactly one terminal row per held symbol, written by
whichever stage terminated it.**  The scan stage terminates a symbol that is
not eligible, is blocked by the floor, or produced no candidates; the run
stage terminates everything else (``sold`` / ``dropped``).  A held symbol
with *zero* rows for a scan-hour therefore means "the cycle did not complete
for this symbol" — a scheduler miss or a /run failure — which is exactly the
silent non-execution the fill-rate check watches for.  See
``docs/operations/DECISION_RECORDS.md``.

    multiplies the day count by the number of ingested symbols (~9x, so a
    1-day gap alerts as 9) — survived the entire suite. Everything load-bearing

    history — AMZN was called away 2026-04-23 and re-assigned 2026-06-06. Under
    ``COALESCE`` the call date wins whenever it exists, so the *new* lot would
    have reported ~30 uncovered days on its first day and tripped the ">= 7"
    alert immediately. ``GREATEST`` takes whichever event is more recent, which
    is the actual question: when were these shares last either covered or
    freshly acquired?

    **Calendar staleness is compensated.** ``stock_history_from_alpaca`` is
    ingested at 17:00 ET, so at the 17:45 ET check today's bar exists but
    intraday runs see a calendar ending yesterday — a systematic ~1-2 day
    undercount that would have made the effective alert threshold ~9 trading
    days rather than 7. Days after the calendar's last bar are added back as
    weekdays. Residual, accepted and documented: a market holiday inside that
    trailing window is counted as a trading day.

    Note ``DATE(transaction_time)`` is evaluated in UTC while the calendar is
    in exchange-local dates, so an activity after 20:00 ET can anchor to the
