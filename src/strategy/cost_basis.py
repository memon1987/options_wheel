"""Shared cost-basis floor resolution for covered calls (FC-065 Phase 1).

Writing a covered call below the cost basis of the shares it covers is a
guaranteed loss. The floor that prevents it has to be the *same* number
wherever it is computed, so it is resolved here and used by both the scanner
(which produces opportunities) and the seller (which executes them).

FC-065 inverted the FC-029/FC-050 chain. The floor is now **Alpaca's reported
``avg_entry_price`` for the equity position** — one broker-authoritative field,
verifiable in the Alpaca UI, already weighted across lots. ``wheel_state`` is
gone from the chain entirely (``STATE_STORAGE_BUCKET`` has never been set, so
it has never been populated in production), and BigQuery is demoted from
floor-*setter* to floor-*verifier*: an inline divergence cross-check that
fail-closes the symbol when the broker's number disagrees with what the
assignment history says the shares cost.

Fail-closed is the discipline throughout: absent / zero / unreadable
``avg_entry_price`` yields no floor, and a divergent cross-check yields no
floor. "No floor" always means "no call", never "any strike".

    engine emits a *total* ``stock_cost_basis`` + ``shares_covered``. Reading
    only the wheel-engine keys is why the execute-time floor never fired on
    the path production runs.

         100: post-FC-038 a covered call can be multi-contract, and dividing
         a total basis by 100 would understate the floor by the contract
         count.

    Returns 0.0 when no floor can be derived; callers must fail closed.
