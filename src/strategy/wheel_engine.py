# FC-078 §4 — roll-cycle time budget, in seconds.

# The daily scheduler job is created with --attempt-deadline 1800s. The budget
# is that minus headroom, and no position is *started* unless the full
# per-position worst case remains: BTC 120 s poll + cancel/verify + up to four
# STO rungs x 120 s. Realistic load is 0-1 executable roll per day; this guard
# exists for the pathological day, where the alternative is a request killed
# between a filled BTC and an unplaced STO.

    FC-068 deleted the orchestration half of this class. ``run_strategy_cycle``
    and everything beneath it (``_find_new_opportunities``,
    ``_manage_existing_positions``, the gap/wheel-state/per-cycle-cap stages)
    had not been called by production since 2025-10-03 — three days before the
    live account's first fill — and the backtest was the only surviving caller.
    Candidate generation lives on the production path only:

        ``/scan`` → :class:`~src.data.options_scanner.OptionsScanner`
        → ``/run`` → :class:`~src.strategy.execution_engine.ExecutionEngine`
        → ``PutSeller.execute_put_sale`` / ``CallSeller.execute_call_sale``

    What survives here is what production actually calls: ``reconcile_positions``
    (pre-trade housekeeping on ``/run``) and ``run_rolling_cycle`` (the Friday
    ``/roll`` scheduler).

                A backtest injects an adapter here; because every downstream
                component already takes the client by constructor injection,
                this single seam redirects the whole graph.
            wheel_state: Reconciliation's in-request position bookkeeping.
                Defaults to a fresh, empty one. FC-069 item 8 (stage 2) removed
                the GCS persistence this used to be pointed at — it had never
                been enabled (FC-039), so "defaults to the configured bucket"
                always meant "in-memory", and now says so. The parameter stays
                because the backtest injects its own instance.
            allow_bigquery_cost_basis: forwarded to CallRoller (FC-065
                Phase 2), which resolves its strike floor through the shared
                resolver. A backtest passes False so it cannot query production
                trade history mid-replay — run_rolling_cycle() runs inside the
                replay too. (Pre-FC-068 this was also forwarded to a CallSeller
                the engine constructed; that seller and its resolver are gone.)
            earnings_calendar: earnings service used by the rolling cycle.
                Defaults to constructing the live Finnhub-backed service. A
                backtest injects a point-in-time calendar, because Finnhub can
                only answer "when is the *next* earnings date" — meaningless
                when replaying 2024.
