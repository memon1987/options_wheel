        """Select opportunities from two independent budgets (FC-038).

        Covered calls are backed by shares, puts by cash, so they are selected
        against separate ledgers: calls draw down a per-underlying available-
        shares budget, puts draw down buying power. Charging calls
        ``strike x 100`` of phantom collateral is what let one call exhaust the
        cash budget and starve every other opportunity in the batch.

        Calls are selected first — they cost no cash, so they cannot displace a
        put. Only one position per underlying is allowed, across both pools
        (risk management rule). Share-committed underlyings are dropped here
        rather than discovered at execution time, so they no longer burn a slot.

        Args:
            ranked_opportunities: Ranked metric dicts (from ``rank_opportunities``).
            available_buying_power: Starting buying power (puts only).
