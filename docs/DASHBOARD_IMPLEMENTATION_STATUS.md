## Troubleshooting

### If No Tables After 15 Minutes

**Check log export status:**
```bash
# Verify sink is active
gcloud logging sinks describe options-wheel-logs

# Check recent logs have event_category
gcloud logging read 'jsonPayload.event_category=*' --limit=5 --freshness=30m

# Trigger more log generation
gcloud scheduler jobs run morning-market-scan --location=us-central1
```

### If Views Fail to Create

**Common causes:**
1. Tables don't exist yet (wait longer)
2. SQL syntax error (check docs/bigquery_views.sql)
3. Permissions issue (verify bigquery.dataEditor role)

**Manual creation:**
```bash
# Create each view individually
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW ..."
```
