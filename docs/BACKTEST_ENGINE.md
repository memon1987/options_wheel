# The backtest engine — what it measures, and what not to trust

**Status:** complete as a **measurement tool**, and **live in production** — a monthly Cloud
Run Job writes to `options_wheel.backtest_runs`. Not wired to any automated *action*:
`demote` is a column, not a trigger.
**Last updated:** 2026-08-01 (FC-068 — the replay now drives the production pipeline)

Programmatic demotion is deliberately **out of scope** — a later motion, once the engine
has been generating real data for a while. Nothing in this system changes the trading
universe today. `demote` is a column, not a trigger.

---

## What it is

It replays the **live strategy code** over historical Alpaca data. It does not
reimplement the strategy — since **FC-068** the replayed objects are exactly the ones
`/scan` and `/run` use:

```
WheelEngine.reconcile_positions()          # pre-trade housekeeping, as /run does
OptionsScanner.scan_for_put_opportunities()
  + .scan_for_call_opportunities()         # candidate generation  (= /scan)
ExecutionEngine.filter_* -> rank_opportunities -> select_batch -> execute_batch
PutSeller.execute_put_sale / CallSeller.execute_call_sale     (= /run)
WheelEngine.run_rolling_cycle()            # Fridays, as the /roll scheduler does
```

driven by a frozen clock against a `BacktestAlpacaClient` adapter. That is the whole
design premise: a reimplementation would drift from production, and a drift you cannot
see is worse than no backtest.

**Before FC-068 the premise was broken in exactly that way.** The replay called
`WheelEngine.run_strategy_cycle()` — a path production abandoned on 2025-10-03, three days
before the live account's first fill. Every backtest run before 2026-08-01 therefore
measured a strategy with a drawdown pause, gap filtering (stages 2 and 4), wheel-state
phase gating on a state layer that has never been populated, per-cycle position caps, and
**single-candidate selection** (first suitable contract per symbol) that production does
not have — and *without* production's top-3-per-symbol → attractiveness-ranked → two-pool
batch selection and its committed-share ledger. Rows written by either engine are
distinguished by `engine_version` (see "things that will mislead you", item 5).

### What changed in the measurement, and why

- **Put leg** — the engine emitted ≤1 put candidate per symbol per cycle behind gap +
  wheel-state + per-cycle caps. The scanner emits top-3 per suitable symbol; `select_batch`
  takes puts by ROI, one per underlying, until buying power runs out, with **no global
  position cap** (production's actual behaviour). Expect more concurrent short puts and
  faster capital deployment; block attribution moves from "gap filter / wheel state" to
  "insufficient buying power / sizing".
- **Call leg** — the drawdown pause is gone (FC-065 OQ-3: it is not ported to the live
  path), so a symbol 5–15% underwater whose chain still clears floor + delta + premium now
  writes calls in replays, as production does. Selection moves from `suitable[0]` to
  ranked-by-`attractiveness_score`, and the FC-038 committed-share ledger applies, so a
  covered position cannot be double-covered. Net direction is symbol-dependent — which is
  why verdicts must be **re-run, not extrapolated**.
- **Gap filter** — stages 2 and 4 no longer run anywhere. Symbols the gap filter excluded
  in elevated-vol regimes (AMD from 2025-01-13 in the FC-002 study) now trade in replays,
  as they always did in production.
- **Assignment basis** — the backtest broker books an assigned lot at `strike − put
  premium`, matching Alpaca's `avg_entry_price`. It used to book it at `strike`, leaving
  the simulated covered-call floor one premium **above** production's. On a $1 strike grid
  (IWM) that was worth a full strike rung.

```bash
python main.py --command backtest --symbol NVDA --start 2025-11-01 --end 2025-12-01
python main.py --command screen                    # whole universe -> BigQuery
python main.py --command screen --no-persist       # analysis only, writes nothing
```

## What it is good for

- **Comparing symbols against each other** under one configuration.
- **Attributing why a symbol does or doesn't trade** — which stage blocked it, on how many
  days. Since FC-057 this includes stage 1, which was previously silent.
- **Answering A/B questions about thresholds** — this is what it did for FC-002, FC-034
  and FC-036, in each case producing a verdict that contradicted the prevailing assumption.

## What it is NOT good for

- **Absolute return levels.** Every known bias points the same way (below). Read a return
  as a floor.
- **The call leg specifically.** See the fidelity table.
- **Anything on a symbol it never traded.** A `0% days in position` row tells you about
  the *filters*, not the symbol.

## Fidelity, measured — the two legs are not equal

| | decisions | strike reproduction | premium on **identical** contracts | delta band |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **put leg** (stale) | 204 | **81%** | ~0.93 of live | 100% |
| **call leg** (stale) | 80 | **55.2%** | **0.676 of live** | 100% |

The call leg's pricing error is roughly **5× the put leg's**, and its cause is unknown —
DTE mix was the obvious explanation and was **tested and disconfirmed** (FC-056). The call
leg was unmeasurable until FC-048, because before that the engine could not produce a
covered call at all.

**Delta-band accuracy is 100% on both legs.** The engine always selects a correct-*risk*
contract. It is the price — and on calls the strike — that drift.

### Every known bias points the same direction

| bias | magnitude | direction |
|---|---|---|
| put-leg premium | ~7% low (identical contracts) | conservative |
| call-leg premium | ~32% low (identical contracts) | conservative |
| modeled bid/ask spread | 2.46× wider than real, RTH-measured | conservative |
| dividends | modeled both legs since FC-042 C1 | ~neutral |
| ex-div early assignment | **never fired on real data** | optimistic |

**Reported returns are a floor, not a forecast.** For a screening tool this is the correct
failure mode: it cannot flatter a symbol into looking tradeable.

## Things that will mislead you if you don't know them

1. **A symbol with 0% days in position is a filter result, not a verdict on the symbol.**
   As of this writing **8 of 14 configured symbols cannot meaningfully trade**: SPY, QQQ
   and AMD are above the `$400 max_stock_price` ceiling (FC-055); F, PFE, KMI and VZ
   cannot clear the `$0.50 min_put_premium` floor (FC-034); MSFT oscillates on the
   ceiling. The effective universe is six: AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, IWM, NVDA, UNH.
2. **"Completed cycles" counts put-expire-worthless turns.** A number like "44 completed
   cycles" can contain exactly one full wheel. Look for `called_away`.
3. **Ex-dividend early assignment has never executed on real data.** It needs a dividend
   payer holding an ITM short call, and the payers are precisely the symbols that cannot
   open a position. Validated by unit tests only.
4. **The engine refuses split-spanning windows** (`UnadjustedCorporateAction`) by design —
   raw bars are correct for point-in-time chain work but cannot span a split. Pick a
   window that avoids the split date; the error message names it.
5. **Two non-comparability boundaries in `backtest_runs`, and only one is machine-queryable.**
   - Rows before **2026-07-29** describe a **put-only** engine (FC-048 — every backtest
     this project ever ran before it misrouted covered calls to the put seller). FC-048
     did not bump `engine_version`, so this boundary is **timestamp-only**.
   - Rows with `engine_version = 'fc-032-phase-5'` describe the **dead engine path**;
     `engine_version = 'fc-068-prod-pipeline'` describes the production pipeline
     (FC-068). Query the version, not the date.

   Do not compare across either boundary. Old rows are never mutated — provenance is
   `engine_version` + `timestamp` + `config_hash`.
6. **There is no gap filter** (FC-049, FC-068, FC-069). Production never ran the stage-2
   filter; FC-068 removed the backtest's only caller with the engine path; **FC-069 item 5
   then deleted `GapDetector` and all twelve `gap_risk_controls` knobs outright** (the code
   lives at pre-sweep `main` SHA `afb6698`). Gap risk is absent by decision. There is no
   stage-2 or stage-4 block rate any more. Note that FC-069 also dropped
   `gap_lookback_days` / `max_gap_frequency` / `execution_gap_threshold` from
   `config_hash`, which is a **second non-comparability boundary** on `backtest_runs`
   alongside the `engine_version` one above: hashes computed before and after 2026-08-04
   differ even when every surviving parameter is identical.
7. **~~The put-side "already have a position on this symbol" skip is silent.~~ CLOSED by
   FC-069 item 12 (2026-08-04).** `_has_existing_position` now emits
   `put_scan_skipped_existing_position` (`reason`: `stock_position` / `option_position`)
   on the live path, so the replay emits it too and the tally counts it as "already holds
   this underlying (scan, put)" — the old stage-6 bucket's replacement. The same change
   replaced the substring match (`symbol in position['symbol']`, which over-blocked: a
   held `PFE…` contract suppressed every F put) with `parse_option_symbol(...)
   ['underlying'] == symbol`, so replays from 2026-08-04 forward reproduce the *fixed*
   check. Two residual limits: the API-error limb still fails closed under its own
   `position_check_failed` event, which is deliberately unmapped (an outage is not a
   holding); and the skip remains positions-based, so a submitted-but-unfilled put is
   invisible to it (FC-009 territory).
8. **The drawdown pause does not exist.** It was never on the live path, and FC-065 OQ-3
   decided it never will be. A replay showing a call written on an underwater position is
   reproducing production, not missing a guard — the cost-basis floor is the guard.
9. **Monitor-cycle churn is unmodeled.** Early profit-taking closed **52%** of real call
   positions before expiry; the replay holds every contract to expiry or assignment. This
   was true before FC-068 and is still true.
10. **Scan time == execution time.** Production scans and executes ~15 minutes apart, so
    live fills against fresher quotes than it scanned on; the replay uses one snapshot for
    both. Unchanged by FC-068, stated here for the first time.

## Re-running the fidelity checks

None of the numbers above are asserted; each has a re-runnable derivation.

```bash
python tools/diagnostics/parity_check.py                     # put leg
python tools/diagnostics/parity_check.py --side call         # call leg
python tools/diagnostics/spread_model_check.py --require-rth # spread, intraday only
python tools/backtesting/coverage_report.py --out coverage.json
```

`--require-rth` exists because an after-hours spread sample makes the model look better
than it is; it refuses to emit a conclusion when the market is closed.

## Track D — DONE (2026-07-30). The screen is live.

The engine runs monthly as a **Cloud Run Job**. `/backtest/screen` remains disabled
(503) and should stay that way — a full screen takes **1h47m**, so no synchronous HTTP
request can serve it.

### What is deployed

| | |
|---|---|
| Job | `backtest-screen` (us-central1) |
| Image | `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/<PROJECT>/options-wheel/options-wheel-strategy:<SHA>` — **Artifact Registry**, SHA-pinned |
| Resources | 1 vCPU, 1 GiB, `--task-timeout 10800s`, `--max-retries 0` |
| Credentials | `--set-secrets` → `alpaca-api-key`, `alpaca-secret-key`, `finnhub-api-key` |
| Schedule | `monthly-performance-review`, **ENABLED**, `0 6 1 * *` UTC (= 02:00 ET) |
| Trigger | Scheduler → **OAuth** → `run.googleapis.com/...jobs/backtest-screen:run` |

### Verified end to end, 2026-07-30

- Execution `backtest-screen-s5dp7` **succeeded in 1h47m39s**
- Wrote **14 rows** to `options_wheel.backtest_runs` (`run_kind='full'`, window 2025-07-30 → 2026-07-29)
- **Verdicts identical to a local run** of the same window — same code, two environments,
  same answer on all 14 symbols (6 `marginal`, 6 `insufficient`, 2 `unfit`)
- Scheduler trigger test-fired and confirmed to create an execution (then cancelled)

### Corrections to what this doc previously said

Three things here were wrong before Track D was attempted, and each would have broken the
deploy. Recorded because the same mistakes are easy to repeat:

1. **Registry.** It said `gcr.io/...`. It is **Artifact Registry**. `jobs create` would have
   failed on image pull.
2. **`:latest`.** It said no `latest` tag is published. **One is** — the build tags both the
   SHA and `latest`. SHA-pinning is still correct for a Job (reproducibility), but the claim
   was false.
3. **Timeout.** It said `3600s`. The real run takes **1h47m**, so an hour would have timed
   out. Now `10800s`.

### Operating notes

- **~5.5 min/symbol**, and the cache never warms — Cloud Run's filesystem is ephemeral, so
  every run is cold. Roughly 16 of those minutes are spent building chains for F, PFE and VZ
  only to discover no put clears the `$0.50` floor: they pass the price band, so the engine
  cannot know until it looks. That is a concrete cost of FC-034 remaining unactioned.
- **Schedule is 02:00 ET deliberately.** A ~2h run must not overlap the trading session; the
  previous `0 12 1 * *` (08:00 ET) would have finished ~09:47 ET, on top of the open and
  contending with the live bot for the same Alpaca quota.
- **`--max-retries 0` is deliberate.** The default of 3 would mean a failing screen hammering
  contract discovery three times.
- **The job name is now a misnomer** — `monthly-performance-review` runs a screen. Left as-is
  because renaming means delete-and-recreate, losing history.

### If it fails

Logs work now (FC-059 — Cloud Run **Jobs** set `CLOUD_RUN_JOB`, not `K_SERVICE`, so log
output previously went to a file inside an ephemeral container and vanished):

```bash
gcloud run jobs executions list --job backtest-screen --region us-central1
gcloud logging read 'resource.labels.job_name="backtest-screen"' --limit 50 --freshness=3h
```

A failure writes **zero** rows — persistence is a single batch after the loop — so a partial
run cannot corrupt `backtest_runs`.

### Before the first *persisted* screen

Persisted rows land in `options_wheel.backtest_runs`, which historically fed demotion
recommendations. Given the engine is being adopted as a measurement tool only, the useful
sequence is: run the Job, read the output, and treat the first few months as **data
collection**. The `demote` column is a recommendation for a human, and the biases above
are the reason it needs one.
