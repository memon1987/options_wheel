# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**Every claim in this file was re-verified against the tree by grep/read on
2026-08-04** (FC-069 item 14, after S1–S6 landed). The previous version
described an orchestration path that had not run since 2025-10-03 and a risk
class that never validated anything. False architecture claims in this file are
not harmless: FC-069 item 14's own argument is that the fictional wheel-state
layer drew ten months of remediation work partly because these docs called it
real. **Do not add a claim here you
have not verified against the current tree.**

## Project Overview

An algorithmic trading system that runs an options wheel strategy: sell
cash-secured puts, take assignment, sell covered calls on the assigned shares,
get called away, repeat. All execution goes through the Alpaca API. Production
is a **stateless** Flask service on Cloud Run (`deploy/cloud_run_server.py`)
driven entirely by Cloud Scheduler; there is no long-lived process and no
durable strategy state (see §Accepted amnesia).

## Plan-First Development

Plan-First Development rules are defined in the parent `CLAUDE.md` and apply to
this project. Project-specific plan files live in `docs/plans/`.

## Development Setup

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set up environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Alpaca API credentials
```

## Commands

**CLI** (`main.py` — `--command` accepts exactly `scan`, `status`, `report`,
`backtest`, `screen`):
```bash
python main.py --command scan    # Scan for opportunities (same OptionsScanner as production)
python main.py --command status  # Portfolio status  (PortfolioTracker — CLI only)
python main.py --command report  # Performance report (PortfolioTracker — CLI only)
```

`--command run` **no longer exists** (deleted by FC-068). It drove a separate
engine decision path that placed real orders against the live account and had
diverged from what production does. There is no CLI trade-execution entry point
by design — trading happens through the Cloud Run endpoints below.

**Testing:**
```bash
pytest tests/ -v                 # Run all tests (1262 collected as of 2026-08-04)
pytest tests/test_config.py -v   # Run specific test file
```

**Code Quality:**
```bash
black src/ tests/                # Format code
flake8 src/ tests/               # Check style
mypy src/                        # Type checking
cd dashboard/frontend && npx tsc --noEmit   # REQUIRED if you touched the frontend
```

The `tsc` line is not optional: an FC-069 S1 dashboard change passed pytest and
two reviews, then broke the Cloud Build image because nobody type-checked the
frontend.

## Architecture — the system that actually runs

**Core strategy flow** — this is what production has run since 2025-10-03 (the
date FC-068 established for the engine path's last live use):

```
/scan    OptionsScanner  ──►  GCS opportunity blob  ──►  /run   ExecutionEngine  ──►  PutSeller / CallSeller
         (stage gates)         (run_id + strategy_id)         filter → rank →
                               30-min freshness                select_batch → execute_batch

/monitor  PutSeller / CallSeller.should_close_*_early — DTE-banded profit-taking (closes only)
/roll     WheelEngine.run_rolling_cycle ──► CallRoller ──► RiskManager.validate_roll  (daily 15:30 ET)
```

1. **`/scan`** (`OptionsScanner`, `src/data/options_scanner.py`) finds and ranks
   opportunities for both legs and writes them to a Cloud Storage blob via
   `OpportunityStore`. The blob carries `strategy_id` (FC-075 Seam 1 — a
   consumer refuses a blob written by another strategy profile) and `run_id`
   (FC-065 P4 — stamped onto the envelope *and* onto every opportunity, because
   the two halves of a cycle are separate stateless HTTP requests).
2. **`/run`** (`ExecutionEngine`, `src/strategy/execution_engine.py`) reads the
   most recent blob that is younger than `strategy.opportunity_max_age_minutes`
   (30), then: `filter_duplicate_opportunities` / `filter_failed_opportunities`
   → `rank_opportunities` (type-aware sizing) → `select_batch` (**two pools**,
   FC-038) → `execute_batch` → `PutSeller.execute_put_sale` /
   `CallSeller.execute_call_sale`.
3. **`reconcile_positions`** (`WheelEngine`) runs first inside `/run` as
   pre-trade housekeeping. It diffs Alpaca against a per-request scratch pad and
   emits assignment/expiration telemetry. Its failures are caught and do **not**
   block execution.
4. **`/monitor`** closes positions that hit their DTE-banded profit target. It
   is never gated — a close reduces risk.
5. **`/roll`** evaluates short calls whose underlying rallied through the strike
   and rolls them up-and-out, **credit-only** (FC-078).

`WheelEngine` is **not an orchestrator**. Post-FC-068 its entire surface is
`reconcile_positions` and `run_rolling_cycle`.

**Scheduler cadence** (Cloud Scheduler, `America/New_York`, Mon–Fri —
live-verified 2026-08-04 with `gcloud scheduler jobs list`):

| Job family | Cadence | Endpoint |
|---|---|---|
| `scan-10am` … `scan-3pm` | `:00`, 10:00–15:00 ET | `/scan` |
| `execute-10-15am` … `execute-3-15pm` | `:15`, 10:15–15:15 ET | `/run` |
| `monitor-9-55am` … `monitor-2-55pm` | `:55`, 09:55–14:55 ET | `/monitor` |
| `options-wheel-roll-daily` | 15:30 ET | `/roll` |
| `regression-hourly` | `:45`, 10:45–15:45 ET | `/regression` |
| `activities-ingest-market-hours` / `-off-hours` | every 15 min 09–16 ET / hourly otherwise | `/ingest-activities` |
| `portfolio-history-ingest-daily` / `stock-history-ingest-daily` | 16:30 / 17:00 ET | ingest endpoints |

`options-wheel-roll-friday` still exists but is **PAUSED** — FC-078 replaced it
with the daily job. The scheduler owns all timing; no cadence knob in
`config/settings.yaml` controls it (a `monitoring.check_interval_minutes` key
used to read as if it did, and was deleted in FC-069 S1 for exactly that
reason).

**Key integration points:**
- All market data and trading flow through the `AlpacaClient` wrapper.
- Configuration is centralized in `Config` (`src/utils/config.py`) — YAML plus
  env-var substitution. One process runs **one** strategy profile, selected by
  `STRATEGY_CONFIG` (`config/settings.yaml` = wheel, `config/covered_call.yaml`
  = the covered-call profile, FC-075).
- Every trading endpoint (`/scan`, `/run`, `/monitor`, `/roll`, the ingest
  routes) is wrapped in `@require_account_match`: the service refuses to act
  when the live Alpaca account number does not equal
  `alpaca.expected_account_number` (503). This pins right-code to
  right-credentials.
- Structured logging throughout (structlog) — the events are the audit trail
  and the dashboard's raw material.

## Trading APIs

- **Alpaca API**: primary API for all trade execution, via `AlpacaClient`.
- **Paper Trading**: enabled by default (`alpaca.paper_trading: true`);
  activities are read from `https://paper-api.alpaca.markets/v2`.
- **Options Trading**: cash-secured puts and covered calls.
- **Finnhub**: earnings dates for the FC-013 gate (`EarningsCalendarService`).

## Key Components (Implemented)

- **OptionsScanner** (`src/data/options_scanner.py`): the opportunity finder —
  both legs, all scan-stage gates, decision records.
- **ExecutionEngine** (`src/strategy/execution_engine.py`): filter, rank,
  `select_batch` (two-pool), `execute_batch`, naked-call block.
- **OpportunityStore** (`src/data/opportunity_store.py`): the GCS blob that
  carries a cycle from `/scan` to `/run`.
- **PutSeller** / **CallSeller** (`src/strategy/put_seller.py`,
  `call_seller.py`): order construction and submission, plus the
  `should_close_*_early` profit-taking logic used by `/monitor`.
- **CallRoller** (`src/strategy/call_roller.py`): the daily credit-only
  defensive roller (FC-078).
- **CostBasisResolver** (`src/strategy/cost_basis.py`): resolves the per-share
  cost-basis floor from Alpaca `avg_entry_price`, with a BigQuery
  assignment-history cross-check; fails closed.
- **EarningsCalendarService** (`src/api/earnings_calendar.py`): tri-state
  (`known` / `unknown` / disabled) earnings dates with a two-layer cache.
- **MarketDataManager** (`src/api/market_data.py`): stock filtering and options
  chain analysis (`find_suitable_puts` / `find_suitable_calls`).
- **AlpacaClient** (`src/api/alpaca_client.py`): API wrapper.
- **RiskManager** (`src/risk/risk_manager.py`): **`validate_roll` only** — the
  roller's gate. It has exactly one public method. See §What actually bounds
  risk for why.
- **WheelEngine** (`src/strategy/wheel_engine.py`): `reconcile_positions` +
  `run_rolling_cycle`. Nothing else.
- **WheelStateManager** (`src/strategy/wheel_state_manager.py`): per-request,
  in-memory bookkeeping that `reconcile_positions` diffs against Alpaca. Built
  empty every request, thrown away at the end. Shrunk from 747 to 331 lines by
  FC-069 S6; its GCS persistence never worked (FC-039) and is gone.
- **PortfolioTracker** (`src/data/portfolio_tracker.py`): **CLI-only**
  (`main.py status` / `report`). Not on the deployed path — nothing in
  `deploy/` or `src/` imports it.
- **Config** (`src/utils/config.py`): centralized configuration.
- **ActivitiesIngestor** (`src/data/activities_ingestor.py`): pulls Alpaca
  account activities into BigQuery — the authoritative record of what happened.

## What actually bounds risk

**There is no central validator.** `RiskManager.validate_new_position` and its
five siblings were deleted by FC-069 S1 with **zero production call sites ever
recorded** — the old claim that "risk validation is required before any trade
execution" was false since inception. Enforcement is distributed by design, and
this is the inventory:

**Scan stage** (`OptionsScanner`, `MarketDataManager`)
- Price/volume band: `filter_suitable_stocks` — `$10 ≤ price ≤ $400`,
  ≥ 2M average daily volume.
- Contract admission: delta bands, DTE targets, premium floors
  (`_check_put_criteria_detailed` / `_check_call_criteria_detailed`).
- **Earnings gate (FC-013, live since 2026-08-03)** — the legs diverge
  deliberately: **puts** block a symbol when the next earnings date is 0–2
  calendar days out (`earnings.blackout_days: 2`, symbol-level); **calls** use a
  true **span** test per candidate — reject when
  `expiration_date >= next_earnings_date`, with no numeric knob, because span is
  the risk predicate itself and is DTE-invariant. Both legs **fail closed** on
  `unknown`.
- Existing-position skip: the put leg skips any symbol already holding a stock
  or option position (parse-exact since FC-069 S3 — it used to be an OCC
  substring test that suppressed every F put because `PFE…` contains `F`).
- Cost-basis floor, scan side: a call opportunity is not created when the
  resolved basis is unresolved or diverges from the cross-check.

**Selection stage** (`ExecutionEngine.select_batch`, two independent ledgers)
- Calls draw down a per-underlying **available-shares** ledger; puts draw down
  **buying power**. Charging calls phantom cash collateral was the covered-call
  starvation bug (FC-038).
- `duplicate_underlying` drop — one position per underlying across both pools.
- Calls are selected first (they cost no cash, so they cannot displace a put).

**Execution stage** (sellers, `execute_batch`)
- Wrong-seller routing rejection (a call routed to `PutSeller` is refused).
- **Execute-time cost-basis floor** (FC-050 / FC-065): a call strike below the
  share cost basis is refused before order submit, reading the floor off the
  opportunity so scan and execute enforce the same number. The basis source is
  Alpaca `avg_entry_price`; it **fails closed**. This is the strongest control
  in the system.
- Naked-call block (`naked_call_blocked`).

**The full gate-by-gate inventory — every gate, its config, its event, and its
fail posture — lives in `docs/gates.md`. Read it before adding or changing a
gate.**

### The real per-ticker bound

There is **no absolute dollar cap per ticker**. `max_exposure_per_ticker:
40000` was deleted in FC-069 S1: it had no preventive consumer, and the
rationale that once justified it ("one put × `max_stock_price` 400 × 100 = $40k")
is arithmetically wrong — `max_stock_price` bounds one *contract*, not a ticker.
What actually bounds per-ticker exposure:

1. `risk.max_position_size: 0.35` × portfolio value, per position — a
   *proportional* bound that **floats with equity** — ≈$36k at the ~$103k
   portfolio of FC-069's sign-off, ≈$70k at $200k — where the deleted knob was
   absolute.
2. One option position per underlying at a time (the invariant below).
3. `strategy.max_stock_price: 400`, capping per-contract collateral.

The operator's decision (FC-069, 2026-08-01, binding) is that breadth is bounded
by **capital and the ticker universe** — both proportional — and that a fixed
count or a fixed dollar cap must not bind future growth. `max_total_positions`
was deleted for the same reason. Accepted residual, on the record: buying power
is the only preventive breadth limit on puts, and the burst scenario stays
count-ungated.

### The one-position-per-underlying invariant, and its caveat

The invariant is emergent, not a knob (`max_positions_per_stock` was deleted in
FC-069 S1). It comes from three legs, carried verbatim from FC-069 item 3:

> **One option position per underlying** emerges from (i) the scanner's
> put-side skip of any symbol with existing positions, (ii) `select_batch`'s
> `duplicate_underlying` drop (one per batch, both pools), (iii) the calls share
> ledger (no double-covering). The invariant is per-*position*, not
> per-*contract*.
>
> **All three enforcing legs are positions-based and blind to resting unfilled
> orders** — a submitted-but-unfilled put is invisible to the scanner skip, the
> batch dedup (across cycles), and the share ledger alike; the invariant is
> "one *position* per underlying, modulo the open-order window" (FC-009's
> standing territory).

## Strategy Configuration

Read `config/settings.yaml` for the live values; these are the ones that matter,
verified 2026-08-04:

- **DTE**: `put_target_dte: 7`, `call_target_dte: 7` — short-dated, for rapid
  theta decay.
- **Deltas**: puts `put_delta_range: [0.10, 0.20]`; calls `call_delta_range:
  [0.15, 0.25]`. **The two are not the same range** — FC-029 R1 tightened calls
  from `[0.30, 0.70]` after three cycles gave up ~$9k of share upside to
  aggressive call deltas.
- **Premium floors**: `min_put_premium: 0.50`, `min_call_premium: 0.30`. The put
  floor is a real universe constraint, not a formality — several configured
  symbols cannot clear it at all.
- **Universe**: 14 symbols in `stocks.symbols`. The **effective** universe is
  smaller: the `$400` price ceiling and the premium floors exclude several
  symbols entirely, so a symbol that never trades is a *filter* result, not a
  verdict on the symbol. `docs/BACKTEST_ENGINE.md` carries the current counts —
  do not memorize them, they move with config.
- **Position sizing — read this carefully, it is not what it looks like:**
  - **Puts execute at exactly 1 contract.**
    `PutSeller._calculate_position_size` computes `min(max_position_size ×
    portfolio ÷ collateral, buying_power ÷ collateral, 10)` and then returns
    `contracts = 1`. The computed maximum is a **feasibility gate** (0 → the
    opportunity is dropped as `sizing_failed`), never the executed size; the
    10-contract ceiling therefore cannot bind today.
  - **Calls are sized by shares**: `available_shares // 100` in
    `rank_opportunities`, then re-checked against the per-underlying share
    ledger in `select_batch` (FC-038 two-pool). A call consumes no buying power.
- **Cost-basis protection**: enforced in code at scan and execute time, sourced
  from Alpaca `avg_entry_price`. There is no knob to relax it.

## Risk Management Philosophy

**Puts**: no stop losses — the strategy is designed to take assignment on
quality stocks (`use_put_stop_loss: false`).
- Assignment probability ≈ |delta| (10–20% for the put range)
- Keep the full premium on most positions; take assignment on the rest at
  strikes chosen to be acceptable entry prices

**Calls**: **no stop losses either, since FC-010** (`use_call_stop_loss:
false`). The stop-loss machinery (`_check_call_stop_loss`,
`call_stop_loss_percent`, `stop_loss_multiplier`) is still in the tree but is
**live-dormant behind the off switch**, kept deliberately rather than deleted.
Disabling it was worth an estimated $1,000–$2,500 in avoided future losses
across 5 historical episodes (`docs/investigations/strategy-review-2026-05-07.md`).
Do not describe those knobs as active controls.

Live covered-call management is, in full:
1. **DTE-banded profit-taking** on `/monitor` — targets ramp 0.35 → 0.80 as DTE
   falls 7 → 0 (`risk.profit_taking.dte_bands`), bounded by
   `min_profit_target` / `max_profit_target`.
2. **The cost-basis floor** — never write a call below the share basis.
3. **Hold-uncovered-until-recovery** — when every strike above basis fails the
   chain criteria, the position simply stays uncovered rather than writing a
   guaranteed loss. `uncovered_days` (FC-065 P4) makes that visible instead of
   silent.
4. **The earnings span gate** — no call may expire on or after the next earnings
   date.
5. **The daily credit-only roller** — when the underlying rallies through the
   strike (`rolling.itm_trigger_ratio: 0.98`), roll up and out for a net credit
   on the placed limit prices, within `max_extension_days: 14` of the *old*
   expiry and under a `max_replacement_delta: 0.60` rail.

## Accepted amnesia (process-local state)

Three pieces of live state are per-instance and reset on every cold start. They
are **live controls with a known, accepted weakness — not fiction** — and the
honest posture is to document them, not to pretend they are durable:

- `_closed_today` (`deploy/cloud_run_server.py`) — `/monitor`'s duplicate-close
  dedup. A cold start between two monitor cycles can allow a duplicate close
  order. **FC-009 owns the fix** (check Alpaca for open buy-to-close orders —
  the cold-start-proof option); it is still open.
- `_failed_symbols` (`src/strategy/execution_engine.py`, module-global) —
  suppression of non-retryable failures within a day; clears on cold start.
- `strategy_status` (`deploy/cloud_run_server.py`, served by `/status`) —
  last-run bookkeeping; resets silently.

**Standing rule for anyone adding durable state here** (inherited from FC-039 /
FC-069 item 8): a configured-but-unresolvable persistence target must **fail
loudly at startup**, never silently no-op. A silent `storage_bucket=None` no-op
is exactly how the wheel-state layer stayed fictional for a year while the docs
called it canonical.

## The detective layer — `/regression`

`tools/testing/regression_monitor.py` is **not a dev tool**. It is served at
`POST /regression` and invoked hourly at `:45` during market hours by Cloud
Scheduler; **any check with status `fail` makes the endpoint return HTTP 500**.
Check groups: `endpoint_health`, `trade_execution`, `log_analysis`,
`position_reconciliation`, `performance_baseline`, `risk_parameters`.

`check_risk_parameters` was synced to the real policy set by FC-069 S1 — four
checks that mirrored deleted knobs (global position count, cash reserve,
portfolio allocation, $40k per-ticker exposure) were removed, because an alarm
layer that mirrors a policy nothing enforces cries wolf and gets muted. What
survives:

| Check | What it verifies |
|---|---|
| `risk_duplicate_underlying` | the one-position-per-underlying invariant (fail → 500); inherits the open-order blindness |
| `risk_max_position_size` | positions ≤ `max_position_size`, **re-sourced from `Config`** and `STRATEGY_CONFIG`-aware, so it cannot drift from policy or validate the wrong profile |
| `risk_naked_call` | no short call without covering shares (fail → 500) |
| `risk_cost_basis_protection` | no call strike below basis, re-specced onto `avg_entry_price` — it used to derive basis from `cost_basis / qty`, which returns 0 for assigned positions, leaving it blind on exactly the lots it exists for |
| `risk_unclassifiable_option` | **warn** — an option symbol that is not a strict OCC contract (adjusted roots after a split). The two checks above exclude such positions; excluding them silently would have inverted the point |

If you change a policy, change its mirror here in the same PR.

## Config discipline

**A settings key with no live consumer is a defect.** This repo's recurring
failure mode is a knob that reads as live and gates nothing — FC-069 deleted
roughly 35 of them in one sweep, across two strata, plus whole blocks
(`monitoring.*`, `logging.*`, `gap_risk_controls.*`) that configured nothing at
all.

The authoritative key-by-key census (every leaf key in `config/settings.yaml`
against its verified consumer) is the **appendix of `docs/plans/fc-069.md`**.
Two things to know before you use it:

- **Any new key must land with its consumer named** — in the code review, and
  in the census if you are touching it. A key without a consumer is born a
  corpse.
- **The census predates `config/covered_call.yaml`** (FC-075 Phase 1, merged
  2026-08-03). Two profiles now exist, and the census's "78 leaf keys" headline
  covers only `settings.yaml`. A knob deleted from one profile must be deleted
  from both — S1 found six swept keys mirrored in the covered-call profile.

## Wheel Strategy Symmetry Principle

**CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULE**: the wheel has two phases that must be treated
symmetrically:

1. **Put selling phase** — entry via `find_suitable_puts()` and `put_seller.py`
2. **Call selling phase** — position management via `find_suitable_calls()` and
   `call_seller.py`

**When making changes to one side (puts OR calls), ALWAYS consider the
equivalent change on the other:**
- Logging enhancements → both legs
- Filtering improvements → both legs
- Error handling → both legs
- Performance metrics → both legs

**Why**: the wheel is a complete lifecycle (sell put → assignment → sell call →
called away → repeat). Both phases need equal observability and consistent
logging for effective debugging.

**Symmetry is a prompt, not a law.** Where the two legs genuinely differ, the
difference must be *stated and justified*, not quietly introduced — the earnings
gate is the model: puts use a symbol-level N=2 window, calls use a per-candidate
span test, and `docs/gates.md` records exactly why. Call deltas differ from put
deltas for the same kind of reason.

**Key files**:
- Filtering: `src/api/market_data.py` (`find_suitable_puts` /
  `find_suitable_calls`, `_check_put_criteria_detailed` /
  `_check_call_criteria_detailed`)
- Scanning: `src/data/options_scanner.py`
  (`scan_for_put_opportunities` / `scan_for_call_opportunities`)
- Execution: `src/strategy/put_seller.py` and `src/strategy/call_seller.py`

## Data Analysis Policy

**IMPORTANT: Cloud-First Data Analysis**
- For ALL analysis of *what the bot actually did*, use data on Google Cloud
  Platform — not local files or caches.
- Primary sources:
  - BigQuery `options_wheel.trades_from_activities` — real fills, the source of
    truth for realized behavior
  - BigQuery `options_wheel.backtest_runs` — screening results (see
    `docs/bigquery/backtest_runs.md`)
  - Google Cloud Storage: `gs://gen-lang-client-0607444019-options-data/`
  - Cloud Run dashboard endpoints
- This ensures analysis reflects production-ready, persistent, centralized data.

**Backtests are the exception, and the distinction matters.** The old
`/backtest`, `/backtest/results`, `/backtest/history` and `/cache/*` endpoints
were **deleted in FC-032** — the engine behind them had never produced a single
trade and one component emitted fabricated numbers. Do not reference them.

The rebuilt engine (FC-032) runs **locally by design**: it replays live strategy
code over historical Alpaca data and needs no cloud round-trip.

```bash
python main.py --command backtest --symbol NVDA --start 2025-10-01 --end 2026-07-01
python main.py --command screen            # whole universe -> options_wheel.backtest_runs
```

**`docs/BACKTEST_ENGINE.md` is the single home of every measured backtest
figure. Read it before quoting any backtest number, and quote numbers from
there, not from here** — fidelity percentages, per-symbol tradability counts and
coverage figures all drift with re-measurement and config changes, and a number
copied into a second document is a number that will be stale in a month.

Three things this file *does* pin, because they are boundaries rather than
measurements — a `backtest_runs` row is not comparable across any of them:

- `engine_version = 'fc-032-phase-5'` — the dead engine path.
- `engine_version = 'fc-068-prod-pipeline'` — the production pipeline replay.
- `engine_version = 'fc-069-scanner-rewire'` — the scanner rewire plus a
  rejection-vocabulary change (2026-08-04).
- Plus a **timestamp-only** boundary: rows before **2026-07-29** describe a
  **put-only** engine (FC-048 — every backtest before that misrouted covered
  calls to the put seller).

Screening results *are* persisted to BigQuery and are cloud-first like
everything else. A local `--command backtest` run is a simulation, never
evidence of what the bot did — for that, always go to
`trades_from_activities`.

**Read backtest output with its stated biases.** Every report carries a
known-bias footer; read it, do not assume its contents. In particular, dividends
and ex-dividend early assignment **are modeled** (FC-042 Track C) — an older
version of this file said they were not, which understated the engine. The
footer states the real remaining caveats, including that dividend coverage
depends on the committed table covering the run window and that early assignment
for non-dividend reasons is still unmodeled.

## Dashboard & Backend Cascading Impact Analysis

**CRITICAL: Before making changes to the dashboard or backend, ALWAYS perform a cascading impact analysis.**

The dashboard architecture has multiple interconnected layers. Changes to one layer can break functionality in others. Always trace data flow end-to-end:

### Data Flow Architecture
```
Trading Bot (Cloud Run) → Cloud Logging → BigQuery Views → Dashboard Backend → Dashboard Frontend
```

### Pre-Change Checklist

Before modifying ANY dashboard or backend component, analyze:

1. **Data Source Changes (BigQuery Views/Tables)**
   - Which backend queries use this data?
   - What fields does the frontend expect?
   - Are there aggregations that depend on specific field values?

2. **Backend API Changes (FastAPI endpoints)**
   - Which frontend hooks consume this endpoint?
   - What TypeScript types need updating?
   - Are there caching considerations?

3. **Frontend Component Changes**
   - What API data does this component expect?
   - Are there shared components (e.g., RecentTrades used in multiple places)?
   - Does the status/display logic match backend data format?

4. **Logging Event Changes (logging_events.py)**
   - Which BigQuery views depend on this event_type?
   - Will existing queries still work?
   - Do frontend status mappings need updating?

### Key Files by Layer

| Layer | Key Files | Impact When Changed |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| Bot Logging | `src/utils/logging_events.py` | BigQuery views, dashboard status displays |
| BigQuery | `dashboard/backend/services/bigquery.py` | All dashboard endpoints |
| Backend API | `dashboard/backend/routers/*.py` | Frontend hooks, data types |
| Frontend Hooks | `dashboard/frontend/src/hooks/useApi.ts` | All consuming components |
| Frontend Components | `dashboard/frontend/src/components/*.tsx` | UI display, user experience |
| Frontend Pages | `dashboard/frontend/src/pages/*.tsx` | Feature functionality |

### Example: Order Status Display

Order status (filled / expired / assigned) is **not** derived from bot logs. It
comes from Alpaca's account-activities feed, which is authoritative and
idempotent. Trace a change through these five layers:

1. **Ingest Layer**: `src/data/activities_ingestor.py` pulls Alpaca activities
   (`FILL`, `OPASN`, `OPEXP`, ...) and dedupes on `activity_id`
2. **BigQuery Layer**: rows land in `options_wheel.trades_from_activities`;
   `trades_with_outcomes` joins them into per-position outcomes
3. **Backend Layer**: `dashboard/backend/services/bigquery.py` queries those
   views — confirm any new field is selected and returned
4. **Frontend Hooks**: add the field to the TypeScript interface in
   `dashboard/frontend/src/hooks/useApi.ts`
5. **Frontend Components**: update the status mapping that renders it
6. **Verify**: premium calculations and other aggregates are unaffected

**Do not add a bot-side order-status poller.** One existed
(`poll_order_statuses`) and was deleted in FC-035. It *ran* on every `/run`
cycle for ~4 months, but produced nothing — 0 events and 0 rows across ~490
invocations — because it only ever inspected open orders, which are never in
a final state. Nothing read its output, and it would have been a second,
non-idempotent writer of facts the activities feed already carries. See
`docs/plans/fc-035.md`.

**Do not write "completed cycle" rows from the bot either.** The
`options_wheel.wheel_cycles` writer was deleted and the table dropped in FC-069
S2: every row it ever wrote had `capital_gain = 0` (it read a state field that
never resolved) and most were cold-start duplicates. The dashboard reads the
`wheel_cycles_from_activities` view, which derives cycles from the activities
feed. Note the separate `options_wheel_logs.wheel_cycles` **view** still has
NULL `strike_price` / `premium` from every feeder — pre-existing rot, not a
regression; do not treat those columns as data.

### Verification Steps

After any change:
1. Check that existing features still work (premium tracking, trade history, etc.)
2. Verify TypeScript compiles without errors (`npx tsc --noEmit` — a required
   step, not a nicety)
3. Test the full data flow from bot to dashboard display
4. Confirm metrics and aggregations are unaffected by display-only changes

## Development Notes

**Alpaca Setup**: requires options trading approval and the paper trading endpoint
**Testing**: comprehensive suite in `/tests` (1262 tests as of 2026-08-04)
**Logging**: structured logging with structlog for trade audit trails
**Configuration**: YAML settings with environment-variable substitution;
`STRATEGY_CONFIG` selects the profile
**Env levers that bypass a deploy**: `EARNINGS_ENABLED`, `ROLLER_ENABLED`,
`ROLLER_DRY_RUN`. Use `gcloud run services update --update-env-vars`, **never**
`--set-env-vars` — the latter wipes the entire env set.
