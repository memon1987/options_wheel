# Low-Price S&P 500 Stock Research for Options Wheel Strategy

**Research Date**: October 1, 2025
**Objective**: Identify S&P 500 stocks trading ≤$25/share with high options liquidity for wheel strategy
**Target**: Lower assignment costs to enable higher volume trading

## Executive Summary

**Key Finding**: S&P 500 stocks trading below $25/share are extremely rare due to index requirements (minimum $22.7B market cap as of July 2025). Most large-cap companies maintain higher share prices or execute reverse splits to avoid appearing "cheap."

**Recommendation**: Ford (F) at ~$12/share is the strongest candidate found and has been added to the trading universe.

3. **Verify Ford passes gap risk filters** (may need adjustment for lower-priced stocks)

### Future Research (if desired):
1. **Expand to $25-30 range**: Consider adding PFE, KMI if performance with F is good
2. **Monitor for new S&P 500 additions**: New constituents may meet criteria
