# Trade Execution Enabled - October 3, 2025

## Change Summary

**Previous Behavior**: `paper_trading: true` (simulation only)
**New Behavior**: `paper_trading: false` (actual trade execution)

**Control Point**: Paper vs. live trading is now controlled by **Alpaca account type** (via API credentials), not the config file.

---

## What Changed

### Configuration Update
```yaml
# Before
alpaca:
  paper_trading: true  # All trades simulated

# After
alpaca:
  paper_trading: false  # Trades execute (paper/live depends on account)
```

### Code Behavior
```python
# In alpaca_client.py line 35
self.trading_client = TradingClient(
    api_key=config.alpaca_api_key,
    secret_key=config.alpaca_secret_key,
    paper=config.paper_trading  # Now False - will execute orders
)
```

---

## Impact Analysis

### Before This Change (Today, Oct 3)

**5 executions ran** (10:15am, 11:15am, 12:15pm, 1:15pm, 1:24pm):
- ✅ Scans completed
- ✅ Filtering stages 1-9 executed
- ✅ Position sizing calculated (STAGE 8)
- ✅ 24 opportunities identified
- ❌ **0 actual trades placed** (simulation only)
- 📊 Logs showed "new_positions: 24" but these were simulated

**BigQuery Data**:
```sql
-- Shows 24 STAGE 8 approvals but no trade executions
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM v_position_sizing  -- 24 rows
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM logs WHERE event_category = 'trade'  -- 0 rows
```

### After Deployment (Next Execution)

**When next execution runs**:
- ✅ Scans will complete
- ✅ Filtering stages 1-9 will execute
- ✅ Position sizing will calculate (STAGE 8)
- ✅ Opportunities will be identified
- ✅ **Orders will be placed with Alpaca** ← NEW
- 📊 Logs will include `event_category="trade"` events
- 💰 **Real capital will be deployed** (or paper if using paper account)

## Account Control: Paper vs. Live

### Current Environment Variables

The system uses these credentials (set in Cloud Run environment):
```bash
ALPACA_API_KEY="your-api-key"
ALPACA_SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key"
```

### Determine Account Type

**Check which account type is currently configured**:

```bash
# Method 1: Check via API
curl -X GET https://paper-api.alpaca.markets/v2/account \
  -H "APCA-API-KEY-ID: $ALPACA_API_KEY" \
  -H "APCA-API-SECRET-KEY: $ALPACA_SECRET_KEY"

# If this works → Paper account
# If 401 error → Live account (try api.alpaca.markets instead)

# Method 2: Check Cloud Run env vars
gcloud run services describe options-wheel-strategy \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --format="value(spec.template.spec.containers[0].env)"
```

### Paper Trading Account (Recommended for Testing)

**Characteristics**:
- Simulated orders (no real money)
- Uses paper-api.alpaca.markets endpoints
- Full order execution simulation
- Same as current behavior but with order logs

**API Keys**: Start with `PK...` (Paper Key)

### Live Trading Account (Production)

**Characteristics**:
- Real orders with real capital
- Uses api.alpaca.markets endpoints
- Actual money at risk
- Requires funded account

**API Keys**: Start with `AK...` (Actual Key)

## Safety Measures (All Still Active)

### Risk Filters (No Changes)
All 9 filtering stages remain active:
1. ✅ Price/Volume filtering
2. ✅ Gap risk analysis (with conservative fallback)
3. ✅ Stock evaluation limit (configurable)
4. ✅ Execution gap check (blocks on large gaps)
5. ✅ Wheel state check
6. ✅ Existing position check
7. ✅ Options chain criteria
8. ✅ Position sizing (portfolio allocation limits)
9. ✅ New positions limit (configurable)

### Recent Bug Fixes (Deployed)
- ✅ Gap detection indexing bug fixed (commit 684e5a5)
- ✅ Conservative fallback on gap errors (commit c9bb4c0)
- ✅ Enhanced logging with event_category (commit ba8aa4d)

### Position Limits
```yaml
max_position_size: 0.40  # Max 40% per position
max_total_positions: 5   # Max 5 concurrent positions
max_stocks_evaluated_per_cycle: null  # No limit (evaluates all)
max_new_positions_per_cycle: null     # No limit (opens all approved)
```

## Expected Behavior After Deployment

### Next Scheduled Execution: 2:15 PM ET (Oct 3)

**Scan at 2:00 PM**:
- Identifies opportunities (same as before)
- Logs to BigQuery (same as before)

**Execution at 2:15 PM**:
1. **Filtering**: Runs all 9 stages
2. **Opportunities**: Identifies stocks passing all filters
3. **Position Sizing**: Calculates STAGE 8 approvals
4. **NEW → Order Placement**: Places limit orders with Alpaca
5. **NEW → Trade Logs**: Creates `event_category="trade"` logs
6. **Order Status**: Tracks fills, rejections, errors

### New Log Events to Expect

```json
{
  "event_category": "trade",
  "event_type": "put_sale_executed",
  "symbol": "UNH251010P00347500",
  "underlying": "UNH",
  "strategy": "sell_put",
  "success": true,
  "strike_price": 347.5,
  "premium": 2.155,
  "contracts": 1,
  "limit_price": 2.05,
  "order_id": "abc-123-def",
  "collateral_required": 34750
}
```

### Potential Errors (Now Possible)

**Insufficient Buying Power**:
```json
{
  "event_category": "error",
  "event_type": "insufficient_buying_power",
  "symbol": "UNH251010P00347500",
  "required": 34750,
  "available": 10000,
  "shortage": 24750
}
```

**Order Rejection**:
```json
{
  "event_category": "error",
  "event_type": "order_rejected",
  "symbol": "UNH251010P00347500",
  "error_message": "Margin requirements not met"
}
```

## Monitoring After Deployment

### Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check current revision
gcloud run services describe options-wheel-strategy \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --format="value(status.latestReadyRevisionName)"

# Should show new revision after build completes
```

### Monitor First Execution
```bash
# Watch logs in real-time
gcloud logging read \
  'resource.labels.service_name="options-wheel-strategy"
   AND timestamp>="2025-10-03T18:15:00Z"' \
  --format=json --limit=100 | jq -r '.[] |
    select(.jsonPayload.event_category == "trade") |
    {time: .timestamp, event: .jsonPayload.event_type, symbol: .jsonPayload.symbol}'
```

### Check for Trade Executions
```sql
-- In BigQuery (after 2:15 PM execution)
SELECT
  timestamp,
  jsonPayload.event_type,
  jsonPayload.symbol,
  jsonPayload.success,
  jsonPayload.order_id,
  jsonPayload.premium
FROM `options_wheel_logs.run_googleapis_com_stderr_*`
WHERE jsonPayload.event_category = 'trade'
  AND DATE(timestamp) = '2025-10-03'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
```

### Check Alpaca Account
```bash
# Check open positions
curl https://paper-api.alpaca.markets/v2/positions \
  -H "APCA-API-KEY-ID: $ALPACA_API_KEY" \
  -H "APCA-API-SECRET-KEY: $ALPACA_SECRET_KEY"

# Check recent orders
curl https://paper-api.alpaca.markets/v2/orders?status=all&limit=20 \
  -H "APCA-API-KEY-ID: $ALPACA_API_KEY" \
  -H "APCA-API-SECRET-KEY: $ALPACA_SECRET_KEY"
```

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If you need to disable trade execution:

```bash
# 1. Update config
echo "paper_trading: true" in config/settings.yaml

# 2. Commit and push
git add config/settings.yaml
git commit -m "Rollback: Disable trade execution"
git push

# 3. Wait for automatic deployment
# Check deployment status
gcloud builds list --limit=3
```

## Recommendations

### Before Going Live (First Execution)

1. **Verify Account Type**
   - Confirm using paper account credentials for initial testing
   - Check account balance and buying power

2. **Review Position Limits**
   - Current: No limits on stocks evaluated or new positions per cycle
   - Consider setting `max_new_positions_per_cycle: 3` for first execution

3. **Monitor First Execution Closely**
   - Watch logs in real-time during 2:15 PM execution
   - Verify orders appear in Alpaca dashboard
   - Check for any error events

4. **Verify After First Execution**
   - Confirm trade logs in BigQuery
   - Check positions in Alpaca account
   - Review capital deployment

### Gradual Rollout

**Phase 1** (Current): Paper account, no position limits
- Test full execution flow
- Verify order placement and fills
- Monitor for 1-2 days

**Phase 2**: Paper account with limits
```yaml
max_new_positions_per_cycle: 2  # Start conservative
```

**Phase 3**: Live account (when ready)
- Switch to live account API credentials
- Start with small position sizes
- Monitor closely

## Questions to Answer

Before the 2:15 PM execution, confirm:

1. ✅ Are we using paper account credentials? (Recommended)
2. ✅ Are position limits appropriate? (Currently: no limits)
3. ✅ Is buying power sufficient? (Check Alpaca account)
4. ✅ Are all safety filters active? (Yes - all 9 stages)
5. ✅ Is monitoring in place? (BigQuery views + log queries)
