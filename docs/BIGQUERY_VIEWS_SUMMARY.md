WHERE date_et = CURRENT_DATE('America/New_York')
ORDER BY stage_number;
```

### 3. Why Wasn't Symbol Traded?
```sql
SELECT timestamp_et, stage_number, stage_result, reason
FROM `options_wheel_logs.symbol_filtering_journey`
WHERE date_et = CURRENT_DATE('America/New_York')
  AND symbol = 'AAPL'  -- Replace with any symbol

## Common Analysis Patterns

### Weekly Performance Report
```sql
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC(date_et, WEEK) as week_start,
  SUM(total_scans) as scans,
  SUM(total_put_opportunities) as opportunities,
  SUM(total_executions) as executions,
  AVG(avg_scan_duration_sec) as avg_scan_time
FROM `options_wheel_logs.daily_operations_summary`
WHERE date_et >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE('America/New_York'), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
GROUP BY week_start
ORDER BY week_start DESC;
```

### Filtering Bottleneck Analysis
```sql
SELECT
  stage_number,
  stage_name,
  ROUND(AVG(blocked) / NULLIF(AVG(passed + blocked), 0) * 100, 1) as block_rate_pct
FROM `options_wheel_logs.filtering_stage_summary`
WHERE date_et >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE('America/New_York'), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
GROUP BY stage_number, stage_name
HAVING AVG(passed + blocked) > 0
ORDER BY block_rate_pct DESC;
```

### Hourly Opportunity Discovery
```sql
SELECT
  hour_et,
  AVG(metric1) as avg_put_opportunities,
  COUNT(*) as scan_count
FROM `options_wheel_logs.hourly_scan_execution_timeline`
WHERE event_phase = 'SCAN'
  AND date_et >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE('America/New_York'), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
GROUP BY hour_et
ORDER BY hour_et;
```

## Maintenance & Updates

### When to Update Views
- ✅ **Schema changes**: If new log fields added to code
- ✅ **New event categories**: If new event_category values added
- ✅ **Performance issues**: If queries become slow

### How to Update a View
```sql
-- 1. Test new query first
SELECT * FROM (
  -- New query here
) LIMIT 10;

-- 2. Update view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `options_wheel_logs.view_name` AS
-- New query here
;

-- 3. Verify
SELECT * FROM `options_wheel_logs.view_name` LIMIT 5;
```

### Monitoring View Health
```sql
-- Check view definitions
SELECT
  table_name,
  table_type,
  creation_time
FROM `options_wheel_logs.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`
WHERE table_type = 'VIEW'
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Test all views
SELECT 'daily_operations_summary' as view_name, COUNT(*) as rows
FROM `options_wheel_logs.daily_operations_summary`
UNION ALL
SELECT 'filtering_stage_summary', COUNT(*)
FROM `options_wheel_logs.filtering_stage_summary`
UNION ALL
SELECT 'symbol_filtering_journey', COUNT(*)
FROM `options_wheel_logs.symbol_filtering_journey`
-- ... repeat for all views
;
```

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Why don't I see Stages 2-6, 8-9?**
A: These stages only log during EXECUTION phase. Check `execution_cycle_results` to confirm executions are running.

**Q: Why are some fields NULL?**
A: Views are designed to accommodate all possible fields. NULLs indicate field not present in that event type.

**Q: How do I query multiple days?**
A: Use `WHERE date_et >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE('America/New_York'), INTERVAL 7 DAY)`

**Q: Can I query data before Oct 15, 2025?**
A: No, views filter `_TABLE_SUFFIX >= '20251015'` to avoid schema conflicts.

## Summary

✅ **12 production-ready views** covering all aspects of system operation
✅ **Tested with real data** from Oct 15, 2025
✅ **Comprehensive documentation** with 50+ example queries
✅ **Designed for weekly evaluation** of strategy performance

**Next Steps**:
1. Wait for execution cycles to populate stages 2-6, 8-9
2. Use [BIGQUERY_VIEWS_USAGE_GUIDE.md](BIGQUERY_VIEWS_USAGE_GUIDE.md) for detailed queries
3. Schedule automated reports using key queries
4. Monitor daily via `daily_operations_summary`
