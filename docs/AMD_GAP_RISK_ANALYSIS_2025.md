## Why AMD Fails the Gap Risk Filter

### Threshold Comparison

- **Gap Frequency Threshold:** 15.0%
- **AMD Gap Frequency:** 23.53%
- **Exceeds Threshold By:** 8.5 percentage points

### Risk Implications for Options Wheel

1. **Cash-Secured Put Risk**
   - High probability of overnight gaps causing deep ITM assignment
   - Today's 37.5% gap would have assigned any put within $62 of the stock price
   - Assignment could occur at prices far above intended entry

2. **Covered Call Risk**
   - Large up-gaps can cause premature assignment
   - Loss of upside potential on gap-up days
   - Difficulty managing positions with frequent volatility

3. **Capital Efficiency**
   - Gap risk requires wider strike selection (deeper OTM)
   - Lower premium collection to maintain safety margin
   - Reduced overall return on capital

## 2025 YTD Backtest Result

**Result:** **ZERO TRADES**

The backtest correctly shows no trades for AMD in 2025 YTD because AMD is filtered out by gap risk on every single trading day. This is **not a bug** - this is **excellent risk management**.

### What This Means

- Strategy never entered AMD positions ‚úÖ
- No exposure to today's 37.5% gap ‚úÖ
- Capital preserved for better opportunities ‚úÖ
- Risk management working as designed ‚úÖ

---

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Keep Current Filter (‚≠ê RECOMMENDED)

**Why:** AMD's gap behavior makes it fundamentally unsuitable for the conservative wheel strategy.

**Benefits:**
- Protects capital from unexpected assignment
- Avoids overnight gap risk
- Maintains strategy consistency
- Today's 37.5% gap validates this approach

**Action:** No changes needed. AMD remains correctly excluded.

---

### Option 2: Adjust Filter to Include AMD (‚ö†Ô∏è HIGHER RISK)

If you want to trade AMD despite the gap risk:

**Configuration Change:**
```yaml
# In config/settings.yaml
risk_management:
  gap_risk_threshold: 0.25  # Increase from 0.15 to 0.25
```

**Required Risk Adjustments:**
- Use strikes 15-20% OTM (instead of 10%)
- Reduce position size to 5% of portfolio (instead of 10%)
- Set tighter stop losses
- Accept higher volatility and assignment probability

**Expected Outcome:**
- Higher premium collection potential
- **Significantly higher assignment risk**
- More frequent position adjustments
- Greater capital at risk

---

### Option 3: Wait for AMD to Stabilize

**Monitoring Approach:**
- Check AMD gap frequency monthly
- Include AMD when gap frequency drops below 15%
- Set up alert when volatility normalizes

**Criteria for inclusion:**
```
IF AMD.gap_frequency < 0.15 AND
   AMD.historical_volatility < 0.50
THEN include_in_portfolio
```

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Gap Risk is Real:** Today's 37.5% gap proves the filter is essential
2. **Risk Management Works:** Zero trades is the correct outcome for AMD
3. **No FOMO Needed:** Missing AMD trades preserves capital for better opportunities
4. **Strategy Integrity:** Wheel strategy requires stable, predictable stocks

## Technical Details

### Gap Detection Methodology

The gap detector analyzes:
- 34-day rolling window of price data
- Gaps defined as >2% overnight price change
- Large gaps defined as >5% overnight change
- Historical volatility from daily returns

### Filter Logic

```python
if stock.gap_frequency > 0.15:
    action = "REJECT"
    reason = "High gap risk"
elif stock.gap_risk_score > 0.7:
    action = "REJECT"
    reason = "Elevated gap risk score"
else:
    action = "PASS"
```

AMD fails both conditions:
- Gap frequency: 23.53% > 15% ‚ùå
- Gap risk score: 1.00 > 0.7 ‚ùå

## Conclusion

**The options wheel strategy is CORRECTLY excluding AMD due to high gap risk.**

A 2025 YTD backtest of AMD shows **zero trades** because AMD fails the gap risk filter on every trading day. This is **proper risk management**, not a system limitation.

Today's 37.51% gap ($61.78 price move) is a textbook example of why this filter exists. If the strategy had sold cash-secured puts on AMD, today's gap could have caused:
- Immediate deep ITM assignment
- $6,178+ loss per contract (100 shares √ó $61.78)
- Forced stock ownership at unfavorable prices

**The gap risk filter protected your capital from this exact scenario.**

### Final Recommendation

‚úÖ **Keep AMD excluded from the options wheel strategy**

Focus on the 14 stocks currently in your portfolio that have stable gap behavior and are suitable for conservative income generation through options selling.
