# Options Wheel Strategy

An algorithmic trading system that implements the options wheel strategy using the Alpaca API. The wheel strategy involves selling cash-secured puts and, when assigned, selling covered calls to generate consistent income from options premiums.

## Overview

The options wheel strategy consists of three main phases:
1. **Cash-Secured Puts**: Sell put options on quality stocks to collect premium
2. **Assignment**: If assigned, acquire stocks at the put strike price
3. **Covered Calls**: Sell call options against the assigned stock position

This system automates the entire process with comprehensive risk management and performance tracking.

## Features

- **Risk Management**: Position sizing, portfolio allocation limits, and stop losses
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track positions and performance continuously
- **Paper Trading Support**: Test strategies safely with Alpaca's paper trading

### Strategy Settings

Key configuration parameters in `config/settings.yaml`:

```yaml
# Strategy Parameters
strategy:
  put_target_dte: 7              # Maximum days to expiration
  call_target_dte: 7
  put_delta_range: [0.10, 0.20]  # Conservative delta range
  call_delta_range: [0.10, 0.20]
  min_put_premium: 0.50          # Minimum premium in dollars
  min_call_premium: 0.30

# Risk Management
risk:
  use_put_stop_loss: false       # Take assignment instead
  use_call_stop_loss: true       # Protect against runaway moves
  put_stop_loss_percent: 0.50
  call_stop_loss_percent: 0.50
  stop_loss_multiplier: 1.5      # Time decay adjustment
  profit_target_percent: 0.50    # 50% profit target
  max_position_size: 0.10        # 10% portfolio per position
```

- **Target DTE**: Maximum days to expiration for new positions (7 days for both puts and calls)
- **Delta Range**: Target delta range for option selection (0.10-0.20 for conservative approach)

## Usage

### Live Trading Interface

Run a strategy cycle:
```bash
python main.py --command run --dry-run
```

Scan for opportunities:
```bash
python main.py --command scan
```

Check portfolio status:
```bash
python main.py --command status
```

Generate performance report:
```bash
python main.py --command report
```

### Backtesting Interface

Run a basic backtest:
```bash
python backtest_runner.py --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-06-30 --symbols AAPL MSFT
```

Backtest with custom parameters:
```bash
python backtest_runner.py --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-06-30 \
  --put-dte 7 --call-dte 7 --put-delta-min 0.10 --put-delta-max 0.20 \
  --initial-capital 50000 --save-plots --export-data
```

Run backtest demonstration:
```bash
python demo_backtest.py
```

### Strategy Commands

- `run`: Execute the wheel strategy (finds opportunities and places trades)
- `scan`: Scan for put and call opportunities without trading
- `status`: Show current portfolio status and positions
- `report`: Generate comprehensive performance report

### Safety Features

- **Paper Trading Default**: Enabled by default for safe testing
- **Separate Stop Loss Controls**: Puts ride to assignment, calls protected
- **Conservative Position Sizing**: 1 contract maximum per new position
- **Quality Stock Universe**: Focus on liquid, established companies (AAPL, MSFT, etc.)
- **Time Decay Awareness**: Stop loss thresholds adjusted for 7-day options

## Strategy Logic

### Put Selling Phase
1. Screen stocks for liquidity, price range, and volatility criteria
2. Find put options with â‰¤7 days to expiration and delta (0.10-0.20)
3. Calculate position size based on portfolio allocation limits (max 10% per position)
4. Place cash-secured put orders at 5% below mid-price for better fills

### Assignment Management
1. Monitor short put positions for assignment risk
2. Handle assignment by acquiring stock at strike price
3. Immediately look for covered call opportunities

### Call Selling Phase
1. Identify assigned stock positions (100+ shares in round lots)
2. Find call options with â‰¤7 days to expiration and delta (0.10-0.20)
3. Sell covered calls at strikes above current stock price
4. Manage until expiration, assignment, or 50% profit target

### Risk Management
- Maximum 10% of portfolio per position
- Maintain 20% cash reserves
- **Puts**: No stop losses - take assignment on quality stocks
- **Calls**: Stop losses at 75% premium loss (50% Ã— 1.5 time decay multiplier)
- 50% profit target for early closure on both puts and calls
- Delta-based stop loss: exit if delta > 0.5 (likely ITM)

## Performance Tracking

The system tracks wheel-specific metrics:

- **Premium Collection**: Total premiums collected from puts and calls
- **Assignment Rates**: Percentage of puts that result in stock assignment
- **Wheel Completion**: Full cycles from put sale â†’ assignment â†’ call sale â†’ call away
- **Early Closures**: Positions closed at 50% profit target before expiration
- **Stop Loss Events**: Calls closed due to adverse price movements
- **Risk Metrics**: Maximum drawdown, portfolio allocation, position sizing compliance

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

Key test areas:
- Configuration loading and validation
- Risk management calculations
- Position sizing algorithms
- Strategy engine logic
- API integration (mocked)
