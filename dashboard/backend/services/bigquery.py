    The dedup is not optional and not cosmetic. Rows are written with
    ``dedup_key = run_id|symbol|stage`` as the streaming ``insertId``, which
    de-duplicates only within BigQuery's short streaming window; a Cloud
    Scheduler retry minutes later inserts a second copy. Reading without this
    ``QUALIFY`` would double-count a retried cycle — the same failure that put
    36 duplicate ``wheel_cycles`` rows in the table per assignment.

    Kept as a module-level builder rather than an inline f-string so the dedup
    is pinned by a test that does not need BigQuery credentials.

    **Within a dedup key, `sold` wins regardless of write order.** A `/run`
    retry after a failed `mark_executed` recovers the *same* `run_id` from the
    blob and re-derives the symbol as `dropped/already_positioned` — the
    position it finds is the one it just opened. Under a pure
    `ORDER BY timestamp DESC` that later row would permanently shadow the real
    `sold` row, in this reader and in every future one (FC-044's grid, the
    OQ-1 in-gap retro-analysis). A write that reached the broker is the more
    terminal fact, so it sorts first.

        **FC-065 Phase 4 repoint.** This used to be ``get_drawdown_pauses``,

        things broke that:

        1. **There is no pause.** OQ-3 removed the drawdown gate entirely —
           the floor is the only gate — so a card reporting "paused" was
           reporting a state the bot does not have.
        2. **The reference price was wrong.** Since Phase 1 the bot's floor is
           Alpaca's ``avg_entry_price``, which is one put premium BELOW the
           assignment strike this query used. Near any threshold the dashboard
           and the bot would have disagreed about the same position.

        The replacement reads the decision records the bot now writes, so the
        card and the alert report what the bot *decided*, not what a proxy
        calculation guesses it decided. What matters operationally is
        unchanged and is the thing FC-030 was really about: **idle capital** —
        shares held with no call written against them.

        Two dedup layers, deliberately: rows are keyed
        ``(run_id, symbol, stage)`` at write time as a streaming ``insertId``,
        and this query dedups on that key again. insertId dedup is best-effort
        over a short window, and a Cloud Scheduler retry minutes later slips
        straight through it — which is how 36 duplicate ``wheel_cycles`` rows
        per assignment happened.
